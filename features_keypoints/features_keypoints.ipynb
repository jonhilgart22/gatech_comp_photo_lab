    "One of the fundamental challenges in computer vision and computational photography is determining which parts of two or more images match -- known as the [correspondence problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_problem). Solving the correspondence problem is useful for automatic image alignment (e.g., for panoramas), object & motion detection, and recovering scene structure from images (among other useful tasks). In this notebook, you will explore keypoint detection, feature descriptors, and see an example application to extract scene structure from camera motion using [OpenSfM](https://github.com/mapillary/OpenSfM).\n",

Harris corners remain one popular feature detector (among [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_detection_%28computer_vision%29#Feature_detectors) others).

    "## Part 2 - Feature Descriptors\n",
    "---\n",
    "Feature detection finds _where_ a point of interest is located, but the points alone lose image context in describing the features they represent. In the previous example, we expanded the Harris corners using the gradient magnitude and angle, but better feature descriptions are more robust to changes in perspective and pixel intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV implements several detectors for more robust feature descriptors like SIFT, SURF, ORB, and HoG, which offer different levels of accuracy & speed. Next we'll cover [Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG)](http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/triggs/pubs/Dalal-cvpr05.pdf) descriptors, which are simpler to demonstrate than the multiscale feature descriptors like [SIFT](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf). (Conceptually, SIFT progressivly extracts locally maximal features from multiscale image pyramids -- the same kind used for pyramid blending.)\n",
    "\n",
    "HoG feature descriptors are generated by splitting an input window of interest into non-overlapping _cells_ of a fixed size and computing a weighted histogram of the gradient directions of the pixels in each cell into a fixed number of _bins_. Next, the cells are grouped into overlapping _blocks_, and the descriptors for the cells in the block are concatenated and normalized. The final feature descriptor for the window is simply the concatenation of all the block descriptors. By default, HoG feature descriptors describe the entire image. Detecting multiscale features involves applying the same procedure to a sliding window over the image and iterating over multiple scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, the window of interest is the full image. It contains 4x4=16 cells, and the cells are grouped into 2x2 blocks. The blocks are computed by sliding a 2x2 box over the cells (the red block moves to the green block, then the blue block, then the black block, and so on over the rest of the image). The Final feature descriptor is the concatenation of the normalized vector in each block, which is a 4x4x3x3x9=1296 element vector.\n",

    "Once you can robustly detect and identify features of interest, you can use them to register & align multiple images of the same scene. (For example in panorama stitching.) The general solution to this problem is called [global bundle adjustment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_adjustment). Bundle adjustment quickly becomes intractable for large image sets because it involves solving a large sparse system of nonlinear equations. Practical solutions simplify the problem by exploiting structure from the application (e.g., sequential images in panorama construction are likely to include the same objects), or limiting the number of images that are pooled together during registration then initializing the global solution with the partial solution of each pooled group. \n",
