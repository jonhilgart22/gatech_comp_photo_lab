# CS6475 Lab Exercises

This repository contains *optional* lab exercises for CS6475 Computational Photography.

## Contents

### 1. Introduction

Introduce key parts of the numpy and OpenCV APIs with an emphasis on applications in computational photography.


## Setup

In order to run the lab notebooks, install [anaconda]() (**DO NOT USE THE COURSE VM**), then clone this repository and create a copy of the conda environment by running `conda env create -f cs6475.yml` from the base directory of this repository. Anaconda will automatically install the required dependencies, and then you can run the notebook by executing `jupyter notebook` from the terminal. The terminal will display a URL that you can copy to reach the notebook explorer which can be used to navigate to one of the notebook files (i.e., a file ending in ".ipynb").

You can edit code in any cell of the notebook, and execute each cell by clicking the "play" icon on the menu bar, or using the "shift + enter" keyboard shortcut. The output of each cell will appear inline in the notebook immediately after each cell.
